      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Macronutrients are nutrients required in large quantities that provide energy (calories) and structural components for the body. The three primary macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats (lipids). Each serves distinct functions: carbohydrates are the primary energy source, proteins build and repair tissues, and fats provide energy, insulation, and aid in vitamin absorption. Understanding macronutrient metabolism, recommended intakes, and food sources is essential for optimal health and performance.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800 mt-6">Carbohydrates: The Primary Energy Source</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Simple Carbohydrates (Sugars):</strong> Monosaccharides: glucose (primary energy source for cells, transported in blood, stored as glycogen in liver and muscles), fructose (fruit sugar, sweeter than glucose, metabolized in liver, found in fruits, honey, high-fructose corn syrup), galactose (component of lactose, converted to glucose in liver). Disaccharides: sucrose (glucose + fructose, table sugar, most common added sugar, broken down by sucrase), lactose (glucose + galactose, milk sugar, broken down by lactase, lactose intolerance results from lactase deficiency), maltose (glucose + glucose, product of starch breakdown, found in malted grains). Simple carbohydrates provide quick energy (4 kcal/gram) but can cause rapid blood glucose spikes and subsequent crashes. Sources: fruits, milk, sweets, processed foods, soft drinks.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Complex Carbohydrates (Polysaccharides):</strong> Starch: storage form in plants, amylose (linear chains) and amylopectin (branched chains), found in grains (wheat, rice, corn, oats), legumes (beans, lentils), potatoes, corn. Glycogen: storage form in animals and humans, highly branched, stored in liver (~100g, maintains blood glucose) and muscles (~400g, provides energy during exercise), depleted after ~18 hours of fasting, replenished through carbohydrate intake. Fiber: non-digestible polysaccharides. Soluble fiber (dissolves in water, forms gel, slows digestion, lowers cholesterol by binding bile acids, regulates blood glucose, sources: oats, barley, legumes, apples, citrus fruits, psyllium). Insoluble fiber (does not dissolve, adds bulk, promotes regularity, prevents constipation, sources: whole grains, bran, nuts, seeds, vegetables). Recommended fiber intake: 25-38g daily for adults (14g per 1000 kcal), most Americans consume <15g daily.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Glycemic Index (GI) and Glycemic Load (GL):</strong> Glycemic Index: measures how quickly 50g of carbohydrates in a food raises blood glucose (0-100 scale). High GI (>70): rapid spike (white bread, white rice, potatoes, sugar, most breakfast cereals). Medium GI (56-69): moderate spike (whole wheat bread, brown rice, sweet potatoes). Low GI (<55): gradual rise (most fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts). Glycemic Load: accounts for both GI and carbohydrate amount (GI × grams carbohydrates ÷ 100), more practical measure. GL <10 (low), 11-19 (medium), >20 (high). Factors affecting GI: food processing (refined > whole grain), cooking method (longer cooking increases GI), ripeness (riper fruits have higher GI), fat/fiber/protein content (lowers GI), individual variation. Low-GI diets may reduce diabetes risk, improve satiety, support weight management, provide sustained energy.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Carbohydrate Metabolism:</strong> Digestion: begins in mouth (salivary amylase), continues in small intestine (pancreatic amylase, brush border enzymes: maltase, sucrase, lactase). Absorption: glucose and galactose via active transport (SGLT1), fructose via facilitated diffusion (GLUT5), enter bloodstream, transported to liver via portal vein. Glucose regulation: insulin (released by pancreas when blood glucose high, promotes glucose uptake by cells, glycogen synthesis, fat storage, protein synthesis), glucagon (released when blood glucose low, promotes glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, fat breakdown). Glycogenesis: glucose → glycogen (when energy needs met). Glycogenolysis: glycogen → glucose (during fasting, exercise). Gluconeogenesis: non-carbohydrate sources (amino acids, lactate, glycerol) → glucose (during prolonged fasting, low-carb diets).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Recommended Carbohydrate Intake:</strong> 45-65% of total calories (Dietary Guidelines for Americans). Minimum: 130g/day for brain function (glucose requirement). For 2000 kcal diet: 225-325g carbohydrates (900-1300 kcal). Active individuals: higher needs (6-10g/kg body weight for endurance athletes, glycogen replenishment crucial post-exercise). Low-carb diets: <130g/day (ketogenic <50g/day), may cause ketosis (fat breakdown produces ketones for energy), controversy regarding long-term health effects. Quality matters: emphasize whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes over refined grains, added sugars.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Health Implications:</strong> Excess refined carbohydrates: linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome. Added sugars: American Heart Association recommends <25g/day (women), <36g/day (men), average American consumes ~77g/day. Adequate fiber: reduces risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, promotes digestive health, supports healthy gut microbiome. Carbohydrate timing: pre-exercise (1-4 hours before, replenish glycogen), during exercise (>1 hour, maintain blood glucose, 30-60g/hour), post-exercise (within 30 minutes, 1-1.5g/kg body weight, optimal glycogen replenishment window).</span></li>

Conditionally essential: normally non-essential but become essential during illness, stress, or growth (arginine, cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine). Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs): leucine, isoleucine, valine, important for muscle protein synthesis, taken as supplements by athletes. Structure: central carbon, amino group (NH₂), carboxyl group (COOH), hydrogen atom, side chain (R-group, determines properties).</span></li>

Enzymatic: all enzymes are proteins, catalyze biochemical reactions (digestion, metabolism, DNA replication). Hormonal: insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, thyroid hormones (some are proteins/peptides). Transport: hemoglobin (oxygen transport), lipoproteins (lipid transport), albumin (nutrient transport, maintains oncotic pressure). Immune function: antibodies (immunoglobulins), complement proteins, cytokines. Fluid balance: albumin maintains osmotic pressure, prevents edema. Acid-base balance: proteins act as buffers, maintain pH. Energy: 4 kcal/gram, used when carbohydrates/fats insufficient (starvation, very low-calorie diets, excessive intake), protein sparing (adequate carbohydrates/fats preserve protein for essential functions).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Protein Quality and Bioavailability:</strong> Complete proteins: contain all essential amino acids in adequate amounts (animal proteins: meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy; some plant proteins: quinoa, soy, chia seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat). Incomplete proteins: lacking or low in one or more essential amino acids (most plant proteins: grains, legumes, nuts, seeds). Complementary proteins: combining incomplete proteins to create complete protein (rice + beans, whole wheat bread + peanut butter, hummus + pita, not necessary at same meal if eaten within 24 hours). Protein quality measures: biological value (BV: proportion of absorbed protein retained, egg protein = 100, reference standard), protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS: accounts for digestibility, amino acid profile, truncated to 1.0, whey/casein/soy = 1.0, most animal proteins >0.9), digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS: newer method, more accurate for low-quality proteins).</span></li>

Higher needs: infants (1.5g/kg), children/adolescents (0.95-1.0g/kg during growth), pregnant women (+25g/day), lactating women (+20-25g/day), athletes (1.2-2.0g/kg, endurance: 1.2-1.4g/kg, strength/power: 1.6-2.0g/kg, muscle protein synthesis optimization), elderly (1.0-1.2g/kg, prevent sarcopenia, age-related muscle loss), illness/stress (1.2-2.0g/kg, increased protein turnover, wound healing). Digestion: begins in stomach (pepsin, HCl denatures proteins), continues in small intestine (trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatic enzymes, brush border peptidases), absorbed as amino acids/dipeptides/tripeptides. Protein turnover: constant synthesis and breakdown, amino acid pool maintained through dietary intake and breakdown of body proteins, nitrogen balance (positive: growth, pregnancy, muscle gain; negative: starvation, illness, muscle loss; equilibrium: healthy adults).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Protein Timing and Distribution:</strong> Post-exercise: 20-40g high-quality protein within 2 hours, stimulates muscle protein synthesis, enhances recovery (anabolic window, may extend to 24 hours for optimal recovery). Per-meal distribution: 20-30g per meal (3-4 meals/day) may optimize muscle protein synthesis better than consuming most protein at one meal, especially for athletes. Pre-sleep protein: 30-40g casein protein may enhance overnight muscle protein synthesis, prevent muscle breakdown. Meal timing: regular protein intake throughout day supports satiety, metabolic rate, muscle mass maintenance.</span></li>

Saturated fatty acids: no double bonds, solid at room temperature, all carbons "saturated" with hydrogens. Sources: animal fats (meat, dairy, butter, lard), tropical oils (coconut oil, palm oil), processed foods. Types: short-chain (4-6 carbons, butter, fermented foods), medium-chain (8-12 carbons, coconut oil, MCT oil, quickly metabolized), long-chain (14+ carbons, most dietary fats). Health effects: raise LDL cholesterol, may increase heart disease risk, but recent research suggests complex (lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic acids have different effects).

Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs): one double bond, sources: olive oil, canola oil, avocados, nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews), seeds, olives. Benefits: improve cholesterol profile (lower LDL, raise HDL), reduce inflammation, may reduce heart disease risk, Mediterranean diet staple. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): two or more double bonds. Omega-3 fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, essential, plant sources: flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, canola oil, converted to EPA/DHA in limited amounts), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, fish oil, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular health, mood), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, fish oil, brain development, cognitive function, vision, recommended during pregnancy/lactation). Omega-6 fatty acids: linoleic acid (LA, essential, vegetable oils: corn, soybean, sunflower), arachidonic acid (AA, can be synthesized, found in animal products, pro-inflammatory in excess). Omega-3:omega-6 ratio: optimal 1:1 to 1:4, modern Western diet often 1:15-1:20 (excessive omega-6), imbalance promotes inflammation.</span></li>

Naturally occurring (small amounts in dairy, meat, from bacterial fermentation in ruminants, conjugated linoleic acid CLA may have benefits). Artificially created (hydrogenation: adding hydrogens to liquid oils, creates solid fats, extends shelf life, improves texture in processed foods, partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats, fully hydrogenated oils do not). Health effects: increase LDL cholesterol, decrease HDL cholesterol, increase triglycerides, promote inflammation, increase heart disease risk (worse than saturated fats), linked to type 2 diabetes, cognitive decline. Regulations: FDA banned partially hydrogenated oils in 2018 (removed from "generally recognized as safe" GRAS list), trans fat <0.5g can be listed as 0g on labels (check ingredients for "partially hydrogenated").</span></li>

Cell membranes: phospholipids form lipid bilayer, cholesterol provides structural integrity, fluidity. Organ protection: cushions organs (visceral fat), insulates body (subcutaneous fat), maintains body temperature. Hormone production: cholesterol precursor for steroid hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, testosterone, vitamin D), eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes from omega-3/omega-6). Digestion: begins in mouth (lingual lipase), continues in small intestine (pancreatic lipase, bile emulsifies fats), absorbed via lymphatic system (chylomicrons) → bloodstream.

        Micronutrients are nutrients required in small quantities but essential for optimal health. Vitamins are organic compounds that cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by the body and must be obtained from diet. Minerals are inorganic elements that serve structural, regulatory, and catalytic functions.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller, absorbable molecules. It occurs in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through the coordinated action of digestive organs, enzymes, and hormones. Absorption is the process by which nutrients pass from the GI tract into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Metabolism encompasses all biochemical processes that convert nutrients into energy (catabolism) and building blocks for growth and repair (anabolism). Understanding digestion and metabolism is essential for optimizing nutrient absorption and energy utilization.

        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Mouth (Oral Cavity):</strong> Mechanical digestion: chewing (mastication) breaks food into smaller pieces, increases surface area for enzyme action, mixes food with saliva, forms bolus (soft mass). Chemical digestion: salivary amylase (ptyalin) begins carbohydrate digestion (starch → maltose, dextrins, inactivated by stomach acid), lingual lipase (minimal fat digestion, more important in infants), lysozyme (antibacterial enzyme, protects oral health). Saliva: 99% water, enzymes (amylase, lipase), mucin (lubrication, forms bolus), electrolytes, antimicrobial compounds (lysozyme, lactoferrin, antibodies). Functions: lubrication (aids swallowing), taste (dissolves food, stimulates taste receptors), digestion (amylase, lipase), protection (neutralizes acids, antimicrobial), speech (moistens mouth, tongue movement). Swallowing: voluntary phase (tongue pushes bolus to pharynx), involuntary phase (pharyngeal and esophageal phases, coordinated by brainstem, peristalsis: wave-like muscle contractions).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Esophagus:</strong> Muscular tube connecting pharynx to stomach (~25cm long). Peristalsis: coordinated muscle contractions push bolus toward stomach (smooth muscle, involuntary), gravity assists in upright position but not required (works in space, upside down). Lower esophageal sphincter (LES): prevents gastric reflux (heartburn, GERD: gastroesophageal reflux disease, when weakened: hiatal hernia, obesity, pregnancy, certain foods/drinks relax LES).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-yellow-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Stomach:</strong> J-shaped muscular sac (capacity: 1-1.5L, can expand to 2-4L). Functions: mechanical digestion (churning, mixing food with gastric juice, forms chyme: semiliquid mixture), chemical digestion (protein digestion begins), storage (holds food, regulates delivery to small intestine), protection (acidic environment kills bacteria, prevents infection), limited absorption (water, alcohol, some medications, aspirin). Gastric secretions: hydrochloric acid (HCl: pH 1-2, denatures proteins, activates pepsinogen → pepsin, kills bacteria, optimal pH for pepsin), pepsinogen → pepsin (protein digestion: proteins → polypeptides, peptides, optimal pH 1.5-2.5), gastric lipase (minimal fat digestion, more important in infants), intrinsic factor (binds vitamin B12, essential for absorption, prevents pernicious anemia), mucus (protects stomach lining from acid, prevents ulcers: peptic ulcer disease when disrupted). Gastric phases: cephalic phase (smell, sight, taste of food, triggers gastric secretion, vagus nerve, 30% of secretion), gastric phase (food in stomach, distension, chemical stimulation, gastrin hormone, 60% of secretion), intestinal phase (chyme enters duodenum, inhibits gastric secretion, hormones: secretin, cholecystokinin CCK, GIP: gastric inhibitory peptide). Stomach emptying: regulated by neural and hormonal signals, typically 2-4 hours, faster for liquids (water: ~20 minutes), carbohydrates (simple: faster, complex: slower), slower for proteins, fats (fatty meals delay emptying, CCK released), emotional state (stress delays, relaxation facilitates).</span></li>

Digestive secretions: pancreatic juice (bicarbonate: neutralizes acidic chyme, raises pH to 7-8, optimal for pancreatic enzymes, protects intestinal lining; pancreatic amylase: carbohydrate digestion, starch → maltose, dextrins; pancreatic lipase: fat digestion, triglycerides → fatty acids, monoglycerides, requires bile for emulsification; trypsin, chymotrypsin: protein digestion, polypeptides → peptides, amino acids; carboxypeptidase: peptides → amino acids; ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease: nucleic acid digestion). Bile: produced by liver (500-1000mL/day), stored in gallbladder (concentrates bile 5-10x), released when fat enters duodenum (CCK stimulates gallbladder contraction), bile salts (emulsify fats: break large fat droplets into small droplets, increases surface area for lipase, micelle formation for absorption), bilirubin (waste product, gives feces color), cholesterol, phospholipids. Intestinal enzymes (brush border enzymes): lactase (lactose → glucose + galactose, lactase deficiency → lactose intolerance), sucrase (sucrose → glucose + fructose), maltase (maltose → glucose), peptidases (peptides → amino acids, dipeptidases, tripeptidases). Absorption mechanisms: active transport (glucose, galactose, amino acids: requires energy, against concentration gradient, co-transport with sodium), facilitated diffusion (fructose: no energy, with concentration gradient), passive diffusion (small lipids, fat-soluble vitamins, water, electrolytes), endocytosis (some proteins, immunoglobulins in infants, antigen sampling). Micelles: tiny lipid droplets (fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, cholesterol) surrounded by bile salts, transport to enterocytes (intestinal cells), diffuse into cells, reform into chylomicrons (larger lipoproteins), enter lymphatic system (lacteals), transported to bloodstream via thoracic duct (bypasses liver initially, unlike other nutrients).</span></li>

Gut microbiome: ~100 trillion bacteria (10× more than human cells, 300-1000 species, ~3-5 pounds), functions (digestion: fiber, some carbohydrates, proteins; vitamin synthesis: K, B vitamins; immune function: competes with pathogens, stimulates immune system; metabolism: SCFAs, affects weight, metabolism; brain-gut axis: affects mood, behavior, neurotransmitters).

Carbohydrate management: counting carbs (standard: 45-60g per meal, varies by individual, medications, activity), glycemic index (choose low-GI foods: whole grains, legumes, most fruits, vegetables, limit high-GI: white bread, white rice, sweets), fiber (soluble: slows glucose absorption, improves blood glucose, LDL, recommended: 25-38g/day, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes), timing (consistent meal times, spacing meals: 4-6 hours apart, avoid skipping meals, prevents hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia). Protein: adequate intake (0.8-1.0g/kg, higher if active, older, supports muscle mass, satiety, blood glucose stability), quality sources (lean meats, fish, poultry, legumes, nuts, dairy, variety). Fat: healthy fats (unsaturated: olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocados, omega-3: fish, may improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation), limit saturated/trans fats (heart disease risk higher in diabetes). Meal planning: plate method (1/2 non-starchy vegetables, 1/4 lean protein, 1/4 whole grains/starchy vegetables), carbohydrate counting (learn to estimate, read labels, measure portions, work with dietitian), exchange lists (similar foods grouped, facilitate meal planning). Monitoring: blood glucose testing (self-monitoring, patterns, adjustments), HbA1c (3-month average, target <7%, but individualized), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM, real-time data, trends, better management).</span></li>

Absorption: enhanced by vitamin D, acidic environment, lactose (infants), reduced by oxalates, phytates, excessive fiber, tannins, excessive protein/sodium (increases urinary calcium loss, limit to RDA, not excessive). Timing: distributed throughout day (better absorption than large single dose), with meals (enhances absorption), supplements: calcium carbonate (most common, requires stomach acid, take with meals, cheaper), calcium citrate (better absorbed, doesn't require acid, take with/without meals, better for elderly, acid blockers). Vitamin D: required for calcium absorption (without adequate D, only ~10-15% calcium absorbed, with adequate D: ~30-40% absorbed), bone mineralization, muscle function (reduces falls risk, fractures). RDA: 600-800 IU/day (15-20μg), higher for elderly (800 IU, 20μg), optimal blood levels: 30-50 ng/mL (75-125 nmol/L). Sources: sunlight (primary source in most people, 10-15 minutes arms/face, 3x/week, varies by: latitude, season, time of day, skin pigmentation, age, sunscreen, cloud cover, limited in winter at high latitudes), fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, cod liver oil), fortified foods (milk, orange juice, cereals, some plant milks), egg yolks, mushrooms (UV-exposed), supplements (D3 cholecalciferol preferred, more effective than D2). Magnesium: bone structure, enzyme function, vitamin D activation (required for conversion to active form), RDA: 310-420mg/day, sources: green leafy vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dark chocolate, fish. Vitamin K: bone metabolism (carboxylates osteocalcin, bone mineralization, may reduce fracture risk), RDA: 90-120μg/day, sources: green leafy vegetables (kale, spinach, broccoli), fermented foods (natto highest), dairy, meat, eggs, gut bacteria synthesis. Protein: adequate intake (0.8-1.0g/kg, higher if active, older: 1.0-1.2g/kg, prevents sarcopenia: age-related muscle loss, falls, fractures), sources: lean meats, fish, poultry, legumes, nuts, dairy, variety.

Portion control: smaller portions (use smaller plates, bowls, measure portions, read labels, restaurant portions: often 2-3 servings, take home half, share), mindful eating (eat slowly, savor food, recognize hunger/satiety cues, avoid distractions: TV, phone, prevents overeating). Meal timing: regular meals (prevents extreme hunger, overeating, maintains metabolism, blood glucose, 3 meals/day, or smaller meals + snacks: 4-6 times/day, whatever works for individual), breakfast (may help weight management, but not essential: individual preference, if hungry, eat, if not, skip, but don't compensate later), late-night eating (may contribute to weight gain: circadian rhythms, metabolism, but evidence mixed, if hungry, eat, but choose nutrient-dense, avoid large meals close to bedtime).</span></li>
