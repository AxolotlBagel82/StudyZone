      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects under the influence of forces. It includes kinematics (description of motion without considering causes) and dynamics (forces and their effects on motion). Newton's laws provide the foundation, while conservation principles (energy, momentum) offer powerful alternative approaches. Classical mechanics applies accurately to objects much larger than atoms moving at speeds much less than light.

Constant velocity: uniform motion in straight line. Changing velocity: acceleration present.</span></li>

Average acceleration = change in velocity/time. Instantaneous acceleration = dv/dt = d²x/dt² (second derivative of position). Constant acceleration: uniformly accelerated motion. Equations: v = v₀ + at, x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at², v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀). Negative acceleration (deceleration) means velocity decreases in magnitude (or reverses direction).</span></li>

Horizontal component: vₓ = v₀ₓ (constant), x = v₀ₓt. Vertical component: vᵧ = v₀ᵧ - gt, y = y₀ + v₀ᵧt - ½gt². Range: R = (v₀² sin 2θ)/g (maximum at θ = 45°). Trajectory: parabolic path.

Angular velocity (ω = dθ/dt, rad/s), linear velocity (v = rω, tangent to circle), period (T = 2π/ω = 2πr/v). Centripetal acceleration (a_c = v²/r = rω², directed toward center) required to maintain circular motion. Centripetal force (F_c = mv²/r = mrω²) provides centripetal acceleration.

Defines inertial reference frames (non-accelerating frames). Inertia: property of matter resisting changes in motion, quantified by mass. Objects maintain their state of motion due to inertia. Zero net force → zero acceleration → constant velocity (or rest).</span></li>

Acceleration directly proportional to net force, inversely proportional to mass. Direction of acceleration same as direction of net force. For constant mass: larger force → larger acceleration, larger mass → smaller acceleration. Units: Newton (N) = kg·m/s². When multiple forces act: ΣF = F₁ + F₂ + ... (vector sum).

Forces always occur in pairs: F_A on B = -F_B on A (equal magnitude, opposite direction, act on different objects). Action and reaction forces never cancel (act on different objects). Examples: person pushing wall (action: person on wall, reaction: wall on person), Earth pulling apple (action: Earth on apple, reaction: apple on Earth with equal force).</span></li>

Kinetic friction: f_k = μ_kN (opposes sliding motion, constant for given surfaces, μ_k = coefficient of kinetic friction, usually μ_k < μ_s). Friction force independent of contact area and velocity (for dry friction). Direction opposes motion or tendency for motion.</span></li>

Statistical mechanics provides microscopic foundation for thermodynamic laws.

Time dilation: Δt = Δt₀/√(1 - v²/c²) = γΔt₀ (moving clocks run slow, γ = Lorentz factor). Length contraction: L = L₀√(1 - v²/c²) = L₀/γ (moving objects contract in direction of motion). Relativistic momentum: p = γmv (increases without bound as v → c). Mass-energy equivalence: E = γmc², rest energy: E₀ = mc² (famous equation, mass and energy equivalent). Total energy: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². At rest: E = mc². For light (m = 0): E = pc. Relativistic addition of velocities: u = (v₁ + v₂)/(1 + v₁v₂/c²) (never exceeds c).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-indigo-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>General Relativity:</strong> Einstein (1915), theory of gravity. Principle of equivalence: gravitational acceleration indistinguishable from acceleration in absence of gravity (elevator thought experiment). Gravity as geometry: mass and energy curve spacetime, objects follow straightest paths (geodesics) in curved spacetime. Massive objects (stars, planets) create spacetime curvature, causing "falling" (planets orbit, light bends). Predictions: light deflection near massive objects (confirmed 1919 eclipse), perihelion precession of Mercury, gravitational time dilation (clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields), gravitational waves (ripples in spacetime, detected 2015 LIGO). Black holes: extreme curvature, event horizon (Schwarzschild radius: R_s = 2GM/c², nothing escapes, not even light). Cosmological implications: expanding universe, Big Bang, dark matter, dark energy.</span></li>
