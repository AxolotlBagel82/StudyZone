      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
        Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of topics, from the molecular mechanisms within cells to the complex interactions of ecosystems. The field seeks to understand the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and classification of all forms of life.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
        Biology integrates knowledge from chemistry, physics, mathematics, and other sciences to explain the phenomena of life. Modern biology is characterized by an interdisciplinary approach, combining molecular and cellular biology with genetics, ecology, evolution, and physiology to provide a comprehensive understanding of living systems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        The study of biology has revolutionized our understanding of health, disease, biodiversity, and the environment, leading to advances in medicine, biotechnology, conservation, and agriculture that have transformed human society.

        Process converting light energy to chemical energy (glucose). Occurs in chloroplasts of plants, algae, and some bacteria. Overall equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

          <span><strong>Light-Dependent Reactions:</strong> In thylakoid membranes. Light absorbed by chlorophyll, electrons excited, electrons flow through ETC, H⁺ pumped into thylakoid space, ATP and NADPH produced (chemiosmosis), H₂O split (photolysis), O₂ released. Photosystems I and II work together.</span>

          <span><strong>Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):</strong> In stroma. Uses ATP and NADPH from light reactions. Carbon fixation (CO₂ + RuBP → 3PG), Reduction (3PG → G3P using ATP and NADPH), Regeneration (RuBP regenerated using ATP). For each turn: 3 CO₂ → 1 G3P (3-carbon sugar). 6 turns produce 1 glucose. C₃ photosynthesis uses Calvin cycle directly.</span>

          <span><strong>C₄ and CAM Photosynthesis:</strong> Adaptations reducing photorespiration. C₄ plants (corn, sugarcane) fix CO₂ into 4-carbon compounds, concentrating CO₂. CAM plants (cacti) open stomata at night, fixing CO₂, then use it during day. Both more efficient in hot, dry conditions.</span>
