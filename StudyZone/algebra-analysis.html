      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">Introduction to Algebra</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that extends arithmetic by introducing variables, symbols, and abstract concepts. The word "algebra" comes from the Arabic "al-jabr" (الجبر), meaning "reunion of broken parts," introduced by the Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in his 9th-century book "Kitab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala" (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing). This work laid the foundation for modern algebra and gave us the term "algorithm" (from al-Khwarizmi's name). Algebra revolutionized mathematics by moving from specific numerical calculations to generalized patterns and relationships, enabling us to solve equations, model real-world situations, understand mathematical structures, and develop abstract reasoning skills that are essential in higher mathematics, science, engineering, economics, and computer science.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Unlike arithmetic, which deals with specific numbers and concrete calculations (e.g., 3 + 5 = 8, 7 × 4 = 28), algebra uses letters (variables) and symbols to represent unknown or changing quantities. This abstraction enables us to solve problems where values are unknown (e.g., "If 3 times a number plus 7 equals 22, what is the number?" translates to 3x + 7 = 22, solving to x = 5), express general mathematical relationships that apply to many different situations (e.g., the distance formula d = rt works for any distance, rate, and time), model real-world phenomena (e.g., profit = revenue - cost, P = R - C), and discover patterns and structures that transcend specific numbers. This generalization allows mathematicians, scientists, and engineers to develop formulas, theorems, and models that have universal applications, making algebra one of the most powerful and widely applicable branches of mathematics.

        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-red-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Ancient Origins:</strong> While al-Khwarizmi is credited with establishing algebra as a distinct field, algebraic concepts appeared earlier in Babylonian mathematics (circa 2000 BCE) with methods for solving quadratic equations, ancient Egyptian mathematics (circa 1800 BCE) with problems involving unknowns (though not using symbolic notation), and ancient Greek mathematics (circa 300 BCE) with geometric algebra, where geometric constructions represented algebraic relationships. Diophantus of Alexandria (circa 250 CE) wrote "Arithmetica," containing problems involving unknown quantities, and is sometimes called the "father of algebra."</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-red-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Medieval and Renaissance Algebra:</strong> Al-Khwarizmi's work was translated into Latin in the 12th century, introducing algebra to Europe. Italian mathematicians in the Renaissance (16th century) developed methods for solving cubic and quartic equations (Cardano, Tartaglia, Ferrari). François Viète (1540-1603) introduced symbolic notation using letters for both known and unknown quantities, significantly advancing algebraic notation. René Descartes (1596-1650) combined algebra with geometry, creating analytic geometry (coordinate geometry), which allows geometric problems to be solved algebraically and algebraic problems to be visualized geometrically.</span></li>

This abstraction has applications in cryptography, computer science, physics, chemistry, and many other fields. Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, linear transformations) is fundamental to modern mathematics, physics, engineering, data science, machine learning, and computer graphics.</span></li>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">Linear Equations: Comprehensive Study</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Linear equations are equations where variables appear only to the first power (degree 1) with no products of variables (no squares, cubes, xy terms, etc.). They are called "linear" because their graphs are straight lines in the coordinate plane. Linear equations have the general form ax + by + c = 0 (two variables) or ax + b = c (one variable), where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. When graphed, linear equations produce straight lines, making them fundamental to coordinate geometry. Linear equations have at most one solution (one-variable) or infinitely many solutions forming a line (two-variable), and they are the simplest type of equations to solve and understand, serving as the foundation for more complex algebraic concepts.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        The simplest linear equation format with one variable. To solve: use inverse operations to isolate the variable, maintaining equality by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation. The goal is to transform the equation to the form x = k, where k is the solution. Understanding inverse operations is crucial: addition and subtraction are inverses (undo each other), as are multiplication and division (undo each other). The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) guides which operations to undo first—undo addition/subtraction first, then multiplication/division, to isolate the variable.

          <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">1.</span>
          <div>
            <strong>Simplify both sides:</strong> Remove parentheses using the distributive property (a(b + c) = ab + ac, a(b - c) = ab - ac, and similarly for negative coefficients: -a(b + c) = -ab - ac), combine like terms (terms with the same variable and exponent: 3x + 5x = 8x, but 3x + 5x² cannot be combined as they have different exponents), clear fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator (LCD) of all fractions, clear decimals by multiplying both sides by an appropriate power of 10. This step reduces complexity and prevents errors in later steps. Be careful with signs: -2(x - 3) = -2x + 6 (distribute the negative), and when combining like terms, pay attention to signs: 5x - 3x = 2x, but 5x + (-3x) = 2x (adding a negative is subtracting).

          <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">2.</span>
          <div>
            <strong>Collect variable terms:</strong> If variables appear on both sides, use addition or subtraction to move all variable terms to one side (typically the left side) and all constant terms to the other side (typically the right side). Choose the side that minimizes the number of steps or avoids negative coefficients if possible, though both approaches are valid. For example, if 3x + 5 = 2x - 7, subtract 2x from both sides to get x + 5 = -7 (variable on left), or subtract 3x from both sides to get 5 = -x - 7 (variable on right, but then multiply by -1: -5 = x + 7, then subtract 7: -12 = x, same result but more steps).

          <div>
            <strong>Use inverse operations to isolate the variable:</strong> Use inverse operations systematically. Undo addition/subtraction first (move constants away from the variable term), then undo multiplication/division (isolate the variable). Inverse operations: addition ↔ subtraction (x + 5 = 12, subtract 5: x = 7; x - 3 = 8, add 3: x = 11), multiplication ↔ division (3x = 15, divide by 3: x = 5; x/4 = 7, multiply by 4: x = 28), and remember that dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal (x/3 = 7 is equivalent to x × (1/3) = 7, so multiply by 3: x = 21). For fractional coefficients, multiply by the reciprocal: (2/3)x = 8, multiply by 3/2: x = 8 × (3/2) = 12.

            <strong>Maintain equality (Properties of Equality):</strong> Whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must perform the exact same operation on the other side. This is based on the properties of equality: Addition Property (if a = b, then a + c = b + c), Subtraction Property (if a = b, then a - c = b - c), Multiplication Property (if a = b, then ac = bc, for c ≠ 0), Division Property (if a = b, then a/c = b/c, for c ≠ 0). This is why we can solve equations—we create equivalent equations (equations with the same solution set) until we reach the form x = k, which explicitly shows the solution. Never divide by zero, and be careful with signs: multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number is allowed and does not change the solution (unlike inequalities, where multiplying/dividing by a negative reverses the inequality sign).

          <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">5.</span>
          <div>
            <strong>Check your answer:</strong> Substitute the solution back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation (both sides are equal). This catches errors and confirms correctness. If the check fails, retrace your steps to find and correct the error. The check should be done with the original equation (before any simplification), not with an intermediate form. For example, if you solved 2x + 5 = 15 and got x = 5, check by substituting x = 5 into 2x + 5 = 15: 2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 ✓, not into a simplified form like 2x = 10.

Positive slope (m > 0): line rises from left to right (increasing function), negative slope (m < 0): line falls from left to right (decreasing function), zero slope (m = 0): horizontal line (constant function, y = b), undefined slope: vertical line (x = k, not a function). Slope formula between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂): m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = rise/run. Interpreting slope: if m = 2, the line rises 2 units for every 1 unit it runs horizontally (steep upward slope); if m = -1/3, the line falls 1 unit for every 3 units it runs horizontally (gentle downward slope); if m = 0.5 (or 1/2), the line rises 1 unit for every 2 units it runs (gentle upward slope). Slope has units: if x is time (hours) and y is distance (miles), then m has units miles/hour (speed). <strong>Y-intercept (b):</strong> The point where the line crosses the y-axis (when x = 0, y = b), represented as (0, b). This is the initial value or starting point in many applications. Example: y = 3x + 5 has slope m = 3 and y-intercept b = 5, so the line passes through (0, 5) and rises 3 units for every 1 unit it runs to the right.

            <strong>Standard Form: Ax + By = C</strong> A form where A, B, and C are integers (preferably with A ≥ 0 and no common factors). This form is useful for finding intercepts, working with systems of equations, and certain applications. To find x-intercept: set y = 0, solve for x: x = C/A (point (C/A, 0)). To find y-intercept: set x = 0, solve for y: y = C/B (point (0, C/B)). To convert to slope-intercept form: solve for y: By = -Ax + C, so y = (-A/B)x + C/B, where slope m = -A/B and y-intercept b = C/B. Example: 3x + 2y = 6. X-intercept: 3x = 6, so x = 2, point (2, 0). Y-intercept: 2y = 6, so y = 3, point (0, 3). Convert to slope-intercept: 2y = -3x + 6, so y = (-3/2)x + 3, slope m = -3/2, y-intercept b = 3.

            <strong>Point-Slope Form: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)</strong> Useful when you know a point (x₁, y₁) on the line and the slope m. This form directly uses a known point and slope, making it convenient for certain problems. To use: substitute the known point and slope into the formula. Example: line passes through (2, 5) with slope 3. Equation: y - 5 = 3(x - 2). Expand: y - 5 = 3x - 6, so y = 3x - 1 (slope-intercept form). To find equation given two points: first find slope m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁), then use either point with point-slope form. Example: points (1, 3) and (4, 9). Slope: m = (9 - 3)/(4 - 1) = 6/3 = 2. Using point (1, 3): y - 3 = 2(x - 1) → y - 3 = 2x - 2 → y = 2x + 1. Using point (4, 9): y - 9 = 2(x - 4) → y - 9 = 2x - 8 → y = 2x + 1 (same result).

            <strong>Intercept Form: x/a + y/b = 1</strong> Where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept. This form makes intercepts immediately visible. Example: x/3 + y/5 = 1 has x-intercept 3 (point (3, 0)) and y-intercept 5 (point (0, 5)). To convert from standard form: if Ax + By = C, divide by C (if C ≠ 0): (A/C)x + (B/C)y = 1, so x/(C/A) + y/(C/B) = 1, where x-intercept is C/A and y-intercept is C/B. Example: 2x + 3y = 12. Divide by 12: (2/12)x + (3/12)y = 1, so (1/6)x + (1/4)y = 1, or x/6 + y/4 = 1. X-intercept: 6, y-intercept: 4.

            <strong>Method 1: Using Slope and Y-Intercept (Best for y = mx + b form):</strong> Plot the y-intercept (0, b) on the y-axis. From that point, use the slope m = rise/run to find another point: move "run" units horizontally, then "rise" units vertically (up if positive, down if negative). Draw a line through these two points. Example: y = (2/3)x - 1. Y-intercept: (0, -1). Slope: 2/3, so from (0, -1), move 3 units right (run), then 2 units up (rise) to (3, 1). Draw line through (0, -1) and (3, 1).

Draw a line through them. Example: 3x + 2y = 6. X-intercept: 3x = 6, so x = 2, point (2, 0). Y-intercept: 2y = 6, so y = 3, point (0, 3). Draw line through (2, 0) and (0, 3).

This method works for any form but can be time-consuming. Example: y = 2x + 1. Table: x = -2, y = 2(-2) + 1 = -3, point (-2, -3); x = -1, y = 2(-1) + 1 = -1, point (-1, -1); x = 0, y = 2(0) + 1 = 1, point (0, 1); x = 1, y = 2(1) + 1 = 3, point (1, 3); x = 2, y = 2(2) + 1 = 5, point (2, 5).

            <strong>Parallel and Perpendicular Lines:</strong> Parallel lines have the same slope (m₁ = m₂). Example: y = 2x + 3 and y = 2x - 5 are parallel (both have slope 2). Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals (m₁ × m₂ = -1, or m₁ = -1/m₂). Example: y = 2x + 3 has slope 2, so a perpendicular line has slope -1/2 (since 2 × (-1/2) = -1). Horizontal lines (y = b) have slope 0. Vertical lines (x = k) have undefined slope and are perpendicular to horizontal lines. Example: y = 5 is horizontal (slope 0), x = 3 is vertical (undefined slope), they are perpendicular.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Quadratic equations are polynomial equations of degree 2, where the highest power of the variable is squared (x²). They have the general form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0 (if a = 0, it's linear, not quadratic). Quadratic equations are fundamental in mathematics because they appear in countless applications: projectile motion (height as a function of time), area problems (rectangles, circles), optimization problems (maximum profit, minimum cost), physics (kinematics, energy), engineering (signal processing, control systems), economics (supply and demand curves, profit maximization), and geometry (Pythagorean theorem applications, area formulas). When graphed, quadratic equations form parabolas (U-shaped curves), which have important properties: they have either a maximum or minimum point (vertex), they are symmetric about a vertical line (axis of symmetry), and they can intersect the x-axis at 0, 1, or 2 points (roots or solutions).

            <strong>a (leading coefficient):</strong> Coefficient of x², cannot be zero (otherwise it's linear, not quadratic). The sign of a determines the parabola's direction: if a > 0, the parabola opens upward (∪), creating a minimum point (vertex is the lowest point), if a < 0, the parabola opens downward (∩), creating a maximum point (vertex is the highest point). The absolute value of a (|a|) determines the parabola's "width" or steepness: larger |a| means a narrower, steeper parabola (vertical stretch), smaller |a| means a wider, flatter parabola (vertical compression). Example: y = 3x² is narrower than y = x² (both open up), y = -2x² is narrower than y = -x² (both open down), y = (1/2)x² is wider than y = x².

            <strong>b (linear coefficient):</strong> Coefficient of x (the linear term). The value of b affects the horizontal position of the vertex and the axis of symmetry (x = -b/(2a)). When b = 0, the parabola is centered on the y-axis (axis of symmetry is x = 0), and the equation simplifies to ax² + c = 0. The sign of b (relative to a) affects whether the vertex is left or right of the y-axis: if a and b have opposite signs (a > 0, b < 0 or a < 0, b > 0), vertex is to the right, if a and b have the same sign (both positive or both negative), vertex is to the left. Example: y = x² + 3x has b = 3 (same sign as a = 1), vertex at x = -3/(2) = -1.5 (left of y-axis); y = x² - 4x has b = -4 (opposite sign), vertex at x = 4/2 = 2 (right of y-axis).

            <strong>c (constant term):</strong> The constant term, which represents the y-intercept of the parabola (the point where it crosses the y-axis, when x = 0, y = c, so point (0, c)). Changing c shifts the parabola vertically up or down without changing its shape or horizontal position. Example: y = x² + 5 has y-intercept (0, 5), y = x² - 3 has y-intercept (0, -3), y = x² has y-intercept (0, 0) at the origin.

            <strong>Vertex Form: y = a(x - h)² + k</strong> An alternative form that directly shows the vertex (h, k). This form makes graphing and understanding the parabola's position and shape much easier. The vertex is at (h, k), the axis of symmetry is x = h, and a determines the direction and width (same as in standard form). To convert from standard form to vertex form, complete the square. Example: y = 2(x - 3)² + 5 has vertex (3, 5), axis x = 3, opens up (a = 2 > 0), narrower than standard parabola. Converting: y = 2x² - 12x + 23. Complete square: y = 2(x² - 6x) + 23 = 2(x² - 6x + 9 - 9) + 23 = 2((x - 3)² - 9) + 23 = 2(x - 3)² - 18 + 23 = 2(x - 3)² + 5. Vertex: (3, 5).

            <strong>Factored Form: y = a(x - r₁)(x - r₂)</strong> Where r₁ and r₂ are the roots (x-intercepts, solutions, zeros) of the quadratic equation. This form directly shows the x-intercepts (points where the parabola crosses the x-axis). If the quadratic has two distinct real roots, the factored form is y = a(x - r₁)(x - r₂). If it has one repeated root (double root), the form is y = a(x - r)². If it has no real roots (complex roots), it cannot be factored over the real numbers (but can be factored over complex numbers). To convert from standard form to factored form, factor the quadratic (if factorable). Example: y = (x + 2)(x - 3) = x² - x - 6 has x-intercepts at x = -2 and x = 3 (set each factor to zero: x + 2 = 0 → x = -2, x - 3 = 0 → x = 3).

            <strong>Factoring Method:</strong> Express the quadratic as a product of two binomials, then use the Zero Product Property (if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0) to find solutions. This method works best when the quadratic is easily factorable. For ax² + bx + c = 0 where a = 1: Find two numbers that multiply to c and add to b. Example: x² + 5x + 6 = 0. Find numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5: 2 and 3 (2 × 3 = 6, 2 + 3 = 5). Factor: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0. By Zero Product Property: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0, so x = -2 or x = -3.

Group: (2x² + 6x) + (x + 3) = 2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3) = (x + 3)(2x + 1) = 0. So x + 3 = 0 or 2x + 1 = 0, giving x = -3 or x = -1/2.</p>

            <strong>Quadratic Formula:</strong> x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a. This method works for ALL quadratic equations, regardless of whether they factor easily. It's derived by completing the square on the general quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0. The formula guarantees a solution (though it may be complex if the discriminant is negative). The ± symbol means "plus or minus," giving two solutions: x = (-b + √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a and x = (-b - √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a. Example: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0. Here a = 2, b = 5, c = -3. Discriminant: b² - 4ac = 5² - 4(2)(-3) = 25 + 24 = 49. x = (-5 ± √49) / (2(2)) = (-5 ± 7) / 4. So x = (-5 + 7)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2 or x = (-5 - 7)/4 = -12/4 = -3.

            <strong>Completing the Square Method:</strong> Transform the equation into (x - h)² = k form, then solve by taking square roots. This method is useful for understanding the derivation of the quadratic formula, converting to vertex form, and solving when other methods are inconvenient. Steps: (1) If a ≠ 1, divide both sides by a to make leading coefficient 1. (2) Move constant term to right side: x² + bx = -c. (3) Add (b/2)² to both sides (completing the square): x² + bx + (b/2)² = -c + (b/2)². (4) Factor left side (perfect square trinomial): (x + b/2)² = -c + (b/2)². (5) Take square root of both sides: x + b/2 = ±√(-c + (b/2)²). (6) Solve for x: x = -b/2 ± √(-c + (b/2)²). Example: x² + 6x + 5 = 0. Move 5: x² + 6x = -5. Complete square: (6/2)² = 9, so x² + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9 = 4. Factor: (x + 3)² = 4. Take square root: x + 3 = ±2. So x = -3 ± 2, giving x = -1 or x = -5.

The x-intercepts correspond to the solutions of ax² + bx + c = 0. If the parabola doesn't intersect the x-axis, there are no real solutions (complex solutions exist but can't be seen on a real graph). Advantages: visual understanding, approximate solutions, easy to see number of solutions. Disadvantages: less precise, requires graphing tools for accuracy, doesn't give exact solutions. Example: Graph y = x² - 5x + 6. The parabola crosses x-axis at x = 2 and x = 3 (can be verified: (2)² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0, (3)² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0).

            <strong>Square Root Method:</strong> For equations of the form ax² + c = 0 (missing the linear term, b = 0), isolate x² and take square roots. This is the simplest method for these special cases. Example: 3x² - 12 = 0. Add 12: 3x² = 12. Divide by 3: x² = 4. Take square root: x = ±√4 = ±2, so x = 2 or x = -2. For (x - h)² = k form: Take square root of both sides: x - h = ±√k, so x = h ± √k. Example: (x - 3)² = 16. Take square root: x - 3 = ±4, so x = 3 ± 4, giving x = 7 or x = -1.

            <strong>Vertex (Turning Point):</strong> The point (h, k) where the parabola reaches its maximum (if a < 0) or minimum (if a > 0) value. The vertex is the "turning point" of the parabola. In standard form ax² + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is x = -b/(2a). To find the y-coordinate, substitute this x-value into the equation: y = a(-b/(2a))² + b(-b/(2a)) + c, which simplifies to y = c - b²/(4a), or more commonly computed as: y = f(-b/(2a)) by substituting into the original equation. The vertex form y = a(x - h)² + k directly shows the vertex as (h, k). The vertex represents the optimal value in many applications: maximum profit, minimum cost, maximum height of a projectile, etc. Example: y = 2x² - 8x + 5. Vertex x-coordinate: x = -(-8)/(2(2)) = 8/4 = 2. Vertex y-coordinate: y = 2(2)² - 8(2) + 5 = 8 - 16 + 5 = -3. So vertex is (2, -3), and since a = 2 > 0, this is the minimum point (parabola opens up).

            <strong>Axis of Symmetry:</strong> The vertical line x = -b/(2a) (or x = h in vertex form) that divides the parabola into two mirror-image halves. The parabola is symmetric about this line: if a point (p, q) is on the parabola, then the point (2(-b/(2a)) - p, q) is also on the parabola (reflected across the axis). This symmetry is useful for finding additional points when graphing and understanding the parabola's structure. The axis of symmetry always passes through the vertex. Example: For y = x² - 4x + 3, axis of symmetry is x = -(-4)/(2(1)) = 4/2 = 2 (vertical line x = 2). The vertex is on this line at (2, -1), and points like (1, 0) and (3, 0) are symmetric about x = 2.

            <strong>Y-Intercept:</strong> The point where the parabola crosses the y-axis (when x = 0). In standard form y = ax² + bx + c, the y-intercept is simply (0, c) because when x = 0, y = a(0)² + b(0) + c = c. This is always easy to find and is a useful point for graphing. Example: y = 2x² - 5x + 3 has y-intercept (0, 3).

            <strong>X-Intercepts (Roots, Zeros, Solutions):</strong> The points where the parabola crosses the x-axis (when y = 0), which are the solutions to the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0. The number of x-intercepts depends on the discriminant: 2 distinct intercepts if Δ > 0, 1 intercept (touching) if Δ = 0, 0 real intercepts if Δ < 0 (parabola doesn't cross x-axis, solutions are complex). The x-intercepts can be found by factoring, quadratic formula, or graphing. Example: y = x² - 5x + 6. Solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, so x-intercepts are at x = 2 and x = 3, points (2, 0) and (3, 0).

            <strong>Parabola Direction and Shape:</strong> If a > 0, opens upward (∪), vertex is minimum point, range is [k, ∞) if vertex is (h, k). If a < 0, opens downward (∩), vertex is maximum point, range is (-∞, k]. The absolute value |a| determines width: larger |a| = narrower parabola, smaller |a| = wider parabola. Example: y = 4x² is very narrow and opens up, y = (1/4)x² is very wide and opens up, y = -3x² is narrow and opens down, y = -x² is standard width and opens down.

            <strong>Domain and Range:</strong> For any quadratic function, the domain is all real numbers (-∞, ∞) because any x-value can be substituted into ax² + bx + c. The range depends on the vertex and direction: if a > 0 (opens up), range is [k, ∞) where k is the y-coordinate of the vertex (minimum value), if a < 0 (opens down), range is (-∞, k] where k is the y-coordinate of the vertex (maximum value). Example: y = x² - 4x + 3 has vertex (2, -1), opens up, so domain: (-∞, ∞), range: [-1, ∞). y = -x² + 2x + 3 has vertex (1, 4), opens down, so domain: (-∞, ∞), range: (-∞, 4].

The vertex gives maximum height and time to reach it. Solving h(t) = 0 gives time when object hits ground. Example: Ball thrown upward from 6 feet with initial velocity 64 ft/s: h(t) = -16t² + 64t + 6. Maximum height at t = -64/(2(-16)) = 2 seconds, h(2) = -16(4) + 64(2) + 6 = 70 feet.</span>
