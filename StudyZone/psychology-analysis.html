      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Biological psychology, also called biopsychology or behavioral neuroscience, examines how biological processes (genetics, hormones, brain structure, neurotransmitters) influence behavior, thoughts, and emotions. It bridges psychology and neuroscience, using methods from both fields to understand the biological basis of psychological phenomena. This perspective emphasizes that all behavior has a biological foundation, from simple reflexes to complex cognitive processes.

        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Neurons (Nerve Cells):</strong> Basic functional units of the nervous system, numbering ~100 billion in human brain. Structure: cell body (soma: contains nucleus, organelles, protein synthesis), dendrites (receive signals from other neurons, highly branched, increase surface area for connections), axon (transmits signals to other cells, can be myelinated for faster conduction, branches into axon terminals), myelin sheath (fatty insulation, formed by oligodendrocytes in CNS or Schwann cells in PNS, increases conduction speed via saltatory conduction). Types: sensory neurons (afferent, carry information toward CNS), motor neurons (efferent, carry commands away from CNS), interneurons (within CNS, process and integrate information, most numerous).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Action Potential:</strong> Electrical signal (nerve impulse) that travels down axon when threshold (~-55 mV) is reached. Phases: resting potential (~-70 mV, maintained by Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pump), depolarization (Na⁺ channels open, Na⁺ influx, membrane potential becomes positive), repolarization (Na⁺ channels close, K⁺ channels open, K⁺ efflux, returns to negative), hyperpolarization (brief overshoot, then returns to resting). All-or-nothing principle: either fires completely or doesn't fire at all. Frequency (not amplitude) encodes information intensity. Refractory periods (absolute and relative) prevent backward propagation and limit firing rate.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Synaptic Transmission:</strong> Communication between neurons at synapses. Process: action potential arrives at axon terminal → depolarizes membrane → voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open → Ca²⁺ influx → triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles → neurotransmitters released into synaptic cleft → diffuse across cleft → bind to receptors on postsynaptic membrane → generate postsynaptic potential (excitatory EPSP or inhibitory IPSP). Neurotransmitter termination: reuptake (taken back into presynaptic terminal), enzymatic degradation (e.g., acetylcholinesterase breaks down ACh), diffusion away from synapse.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Major Neurotransmitters:</strong> Dopamine (reward, motivation, motor control, implicated in Parkinson's, schizophrenia, addiction), serotonin (mood, sleep, appetite, implicated in depression, anxiety), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid, major inhibitory neurotransmitter, reduces neural activity, implicated in anxiety, seizures), glutamate (major excitatory neurotransmitter, learning and memory, implicated in seizures, neurodegenerative diseases), acetylcholine (ACh, muscle contraction, attention, memory, implicated in Alzheimer's), norepinephrine (arousal, attention, stress response, fight-or-flight), endorphins (pain relief, pleasure, "runner's high").</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Neuroplasticity:</strong> Brain's ability to reorganize and form new neural connections throughout life. Synaptic plasticity: strengthening (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakening (long-term depression, LTD) of synapses based on activity. Structural plasticity: formation of new neurons (neurogenesis, limited in adults, occurs in hippocampus), new dendrites, new synapses. Critical for learning, memory, recovery from brain injury. Experience-dependent plasticity: brain changes based on experiences, use-dependent reorganization.</span></li>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Cognitive psychology studies mental processes including perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, decision-making, and thinking. It views the mind as an information-processing system, similar to a computer. Cognitive psychologists use experimental methods to understand how people acquire, process, store, and retrieve information. This field has revolutionized understanding of human cognition and has applications in education, therapy, technology design, and artificial intelligence.

        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Sensory Memory:</strong> Brief storage of sensory information (milliseconds to seconds). Iconic memory (visual, ~0.5 seconds, large capacity, allows perception of continuity), echoic memory (auditory, ~2-4 seconds, allows understanding of speech). Acts as buffer, most information lost unless attended to. Sperling's partial report technique demonstrated large capacity of iconic memory.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Short-Term Memory (STM) / Working Memory:</strong> Active processing and temporary storage. Limited capacity: Miller's "magic number" 7±2 items (chunking increases effective capacity). Duration: ~20-30 seconds without rehearsal (maintenance rehearsal: simple repetition, elaborative rehearsal: meaningful processing, more effective). Working memory model (Baddeley): central executive (controls attention), phonological loop (verbal information), visuospatial sketchpad (visual-spatial information), episodic buffer (integrates information). Working memory capacity predicts academic performance, intelligence, problem-solving ability.</span></li>

Explicit (declarative) memory: conscious recall. Semantic memory (facts, knowledge, concepts, "knowing that"), episodic memory (personal experiences, events, "remembering when," includes time and place). Implicit (non-declarative) memory: unconscious influence. Procedural memory (skills, habits, "knowing how," e.g., riding bike, typing), priming (previous exposure facilitates processing), classical conditioning (associations). Consolidation: process of stabilizing memories, involves hippocampus initially, then distributed to cortex. Reconsolidation: memories can be modified when retrieved.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Encoding:</strong> Process of transferring information into memory. Levels of processing (Craik & Lockhart): shallow (physical features, poor retention), intermediate (acoustic/phonetic, moderate), deep (semantic/meaningful, best retention). Elaborative rehearsal (relating to existing knowledge) superior to maintenance rehearsal. Encoding specificity: memory better when encoding and retrieval contexts match. Mnemonic devices: method of loci (mental walk), peg-word system, acronyms, chunking.</span></li>

Recognition (identifying previously encountered information, easier than recall) vs. recall (reproducing information without cues, more difficult). Retrieval cues: context-dependent memory (better recall in same environment), state-dependent memory (better recall in same physiological/emotional state), mood-congruent memory (recall memories matching current mood). Serial position effect: primacy effect (better recall of first items) and recency effect (better recall of last items). Forgetting: decay (fading over time), interference (proactive: old interferes with new, retroactive: new interferes with old), retrieval failure (information available but not accessible, tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon), motivated forgetting (repression, suppression).</span></li>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Social psychology studies how individuals think, feel, and behave in social contexts and how social situations influence behavior. It examines the interaction between individual and social factors, exploring topics such as social perception, attitudes, group dynamics, relationships, and social influence. Social psychologists investigate how people are influenced by the presence (real or imagined) of others, how they form impressions of others, and how they navigate social relationships. Key principle: behavior is a function of both the person and the situation.

        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Attribution Theory (Heider, Kelley):</strong> How people explain behavior. Internal (dispositional) attributions: behavior due to person's traits, abilities, motives. External (situational) attributions: behavior due to situation, circumstances, luck. Covariation model (Kelley): consistency (does person always behave this way?), distinctiveness (does person behave differently in other situations?), consensus (do others behave similarly?). Fundamental attribution error (correspondence bias): overestimating internal factors, underestimating external factors when explaining others' behavior (especially in Western cultures). Self-serving bias: attributing successes to internal factors, failures to external factors. Actor-observer bias: attributing own behavior to situation, others' behavior to disposition.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Social Perception:</strong> Forming impressions of others. Primacy effect: first impressions matter, difficult to change. Halo effect: one positive trait influences perception of other traits. Stereotypes: cognitive schemas about groups, can be positive or negative, often automatic, can lead to prejudice. Self-fulfilling prophecy: expectations influence behavior, causing expectations to come true (Rosenthal & Jacobson: Pygmalion effect in classrooms).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Attitudes:</strong> Evaluations (positive/negative) of people, objects, ideas. Components: affective (emotions), behavioral (actions), cognitive (beliefs). Attitude-behavior consistency: attitudes predict behavior when strong, accessible, specific, when social pressures minimal. Theory of planned behavior: attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control predict intentions and behavior. Cognitive dissonance (Festinger): discomfort from holding conflicting beliefs/attitudes, motivates change (reduce dissonance by changing attitude, behavior, or adding consonant cognitions).</span></li>

Asch's line experiments: ~75% conformed at least once, even when clearly wrong. Types: informational conformity (believing others are correct, seeking accuracy), normative conformity (fitting in, avoiding rejection). Factors increasing conformity: group size (up to 3-4), unanimity (one dissenter reduces conformity), culture (collectivistic > individualistic), low self-esteem, ambiguity of situation. Factors decreasing: one dissenter, high self-confidence, individualistic culture.</span></li>

Techniques: foot-in-the-door (small request → larger request), door-in-the-face (large request → smaller request), low-ball (agree to attractive offer → reveal hidden costs), that's-not-all (add bonus before response), scarcity (limited availability increases value).</span></li>

Milgram's experiments: ~65% administered maximum shock (450V) when ordered by experimenter. Factors: proximity of authority (closer = more obedience), legitimacy of authority, distance from victim (further = more obedience), gradual escalation (small steps), responsibility diffusion. Ethical concerns raised about Milgram's research. Real-world applications: understanding Holocaust, military obedience, workplace compliance.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Group Dynamics:</strong> Social facilitation: presence of others improves performance on simple/well-learned tasks, impairs complex/new tasks (Zajonc: arousal increases dominant response). Social loafing: reduced effort in groups (free-rider effect), more common in larger groups, when individual contributions not identifiable. Deindividuation: loss of self-awareness in groups, reduced personal responsibility, can lead to antisocial behavior (mob behavior, online anonymity). Group polarization: groups make more extreme decisions than individuals (risky shift, cautious shift).</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Groupthink (Janis):</strong> Poor decision-making in cohesive groups due to pressure for consensus. Symptoms: illusion of invulnerability, collective rationalization, belief in group's morality, stereotyping outgroups, self-censorship, illusion of unanimity, mindguards (protecting group from dissenting information). Conditions: cohesive group, isolated from outside, directive leader, high stress, lack of decision-making procedures. Examples: Bay of Pigs, Challenger disaster. Prevention: encourage dissent, outside experts, subgroups, anonymous input, leader holds back opinions.</span></li>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Personality psychology studies individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It seeks to understand how personality develops, how it influences behavior, and how it can be measured. Personality psychologists investigate both universal aspects of personality and individual differences, exploring questions about consistency, stability, and change across situations and over time.

        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Psychoanalytic Theory (Freud):</strong> Personality structure: id (pleasure principle, unconscious, primitive drives), ego (reality principle, mediates between id and superego), superego (morality principle, conscience, internalized values). Psychosexual stages: oral (0-1 year, mouth), anal (1-3 years, control), phallic (3-6 years, Oedipus/Electra complex), latency (6-12 years, sexual feelings repressed), genital (puberty+, mature sexuality). Defense mechanisms: repression (unconscious blocking), denial (refusing to accept reality), projection (attributing own unacceptable feelings to others), displacement (redirecting emotions to safer target), rationalization (justifying with excuses), sublimation (channeling into acceptable activities), regression (returning to earlier stage). Criticisms: difficult to test, overemphasis on sexuality, male bias, lack of empirical support.</span></li>
        <li class="flex items-start gap-3"><span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">•</span><span><strong>Trait Theory:</strong> Personality consists of stable traits (enduring characteristics). Big Five (Five-Factor Model): openness (imagination, curiosity, creativity), conscientiousness (organization, self-discipline, dependability), extraversion (sociability, assertiveness, positive emotions), agreeableness (trust, altruism, cooperation), neuroticism (anxiety, emotional instability, negative emotions). Each trait on continuum, relatively stable over time, heritable (~40-60%), cross-culturally valid. HEXACO model: adds honesty-humility. Eysenck's three-factor model: extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism. Trait vs. state: traits are stable, states are temporary.</span></li>

Maslow's hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, self-actualization (fulfilling potential). Rogers: self-concept (perceptions of self), unconditional positive regard (acceptance), conditions of worth (conditional acceptance leads to incongruence), fully functioning person (open to experience, trust in self, internal locus of evaluation).</span></li>

Temperament: early-appearing, biologically based individual differences (activity level, emotionality, sociability). Eysenck: extraversion related to arousal (introverts more easily aroused), neuroticism related to emotional reactivity. Brain structure: prefrontal cortex (conscientiousness, self-control), amygdala (neuroticism, fear).</span></li>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge due to experience. Behavioral psychology focuses on observable behavior and how it's acquired and modified through learning processes. Two primary forms of learning are classical conditioning and operant conditioning, which explain how associations are formed between stimuli and responses.

Acquisition: pairing CS with UCS, CR develops. Extinction: CS presented without UCS, CR weakens. Spontaneous recovery: extinguished CR reappears after rest period. Generalization: similar stimuli elicit CR. Discrimination: distinguishing between similar stimuli. Higher-order conditioning: CS becomes UCS for new conditioning.</span></li>

Punishment: decreases behavior. Positive punishment (adding aversive stimulus, e.g., spanking, scolding), negative punishment (removing desirable stimulus, e.g., time-out, taking away privileges). Reinforcement schedules: continuous (every response reinforced, rapid learning, rapid extinction), partial/intermittent (some responses reinforced, slower learning, slower extinction). Fixed ratio (FR: after set number of responses, e.g., FR-5), variable ratio (VR: average number, e.g., VR-5, high rate, resistant to extinction, e.g., gambling), fixed interval (FI: after set time, e.g., FI-60s, scalloped pattern), variable interval (VI: average time, e.g., VI-60s, steady rate).</span></li>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
        Motivation refers to the processes that initiate, direct, and sustain goal-directed behavior. Emotion involves subjective experience, physiological arousal, and expressive behavior. Both motivation and emotion are fundamental to understanding human behavior, influencing what we do, how we feel, and how we respond to the world around us.
